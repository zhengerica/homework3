    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p id = "main"> 
        My name is Erica Zheng and I am a 3rd year studying data science and 
        business with a concentration in finance, minoring in architectural design. On campus
        I am the director of events and marketing of Disrupt, the fintech initiative, and the
        director of venture acceleration of IDEA, the Northeastern's venture accelerator.
        Food plays a big part in my life because it is what fills me up and keeps me going
        throughout the day. I have two go-to meals, a mexican bowl from El Jefes, and my
        tried and true spam fried rice. My spam fried rice was inspired by the popular Hawaiian
        snack, spam musubi, which consist of a block of rice with a slice of spam glazed in
        a sweet, soy sauce mixture, wrapped with a piece of nori, seaweed. Once in high school,
        I was too lazy to put it together, and decided to make a "deconstructed" spam musubi. I
        added my own touch to it, adding egg, and instead of a piece of nori, I grabbed a pack of
        snacked seaweed. 4 years later, it is not only my go-to meal in college but a highly
        requested meal by all my friends.
