   If you are using day-old rice, heat it up in the microwave for about 1 minute before you
   start cooking, and make sure you portion it for one serving. All you have to do to prep
   is to slice your spam, about two to three slices per serving, and make your sauce. In a
   small sauce bowl, mix together oyster sauce, soy sauce, and a bit of sugar. Another good
   option is to use teriyaki sauce if you like a slightly sweeter flavor. In a pan, cook one
   egg however you like, whether it is scrambled, fried, or sunny-side up. Then, grill your
   spam for about two minutes on medium-high heat on each side until it becomes golden and
   slightly crispy. Once cooked, pour the sauce over the spam and make sure every piece is
   coated evenly. When everything is done, you can either mix the egg into the rice or place
   it on top, followed by the crispy and fragrant spam. This simple dish makes the perfect meal,
   whether you eat it with rice, egg, and spam all together, or wrap it in a piece of seaweed
   like a sushi roll. Add some yum yum sauce for an extra creamy bite.
